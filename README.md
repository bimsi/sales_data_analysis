# Sales Data Analysis Project  

## 1. Project Overview  
**Objective:**  
To analyze sales performance, identify trends, and evaluate product category performance using historical sales data.  

**Scope:**  
- Time period covered in the dataset  
- Key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer count  
- Monthly sales trends and product category performance  

**Outcome:**  
- Clear understanding of sales patterns  
- Identification of top-performing product categories  
- Data-driven insights for business decision-making  

## 2. Key Components  

### A. Data Collection  
**Sources:**  
- Sales data extracted from a CSV file (`sales_data_sample.csv`)  

**Metrics Tracked:**  
- Total sales  
- Average order value  
- Number of unique customers  
- Monthly sales trends  
- Sales by product category  

### B. Analysis Framework  
**Quantitative Analysis:**  
- Aggregation of sales by month and product category  
- Calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs)  

**Qualitative Analysis:**  
- Interpretation of trends in monthly sales  
- Comparison of product category performance  

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization)  

### C. Key Findings  
- The dataset covers sales from [start date] to [end date].  
- Total sales amounted to [total sales value].  
- The average order value was [average order value].  
- [Number] unique customers were recorded in the dataset.  
- Monthly sales trends showed [increasing/declining/stable] performance.
